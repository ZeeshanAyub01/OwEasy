The project currently has basic functionality working at its front-end. 

How the project works:
1. Click on the get started button, or scroll down to add the names of the pariticipants in the group
2. Add all the transactions (lending and borrowing) that happened between participants
3. Click on the button that says Resolve! The resolution of all the transactions added up until that point will be displayed below the resolve button.

Note:
I discovered a glitch recently with the program, that the program crashes if one or more of the particpants haven't been added to any of the 
transactions. So make sure to include each participant in atleast one of the transactions. I will soon fix this issue.
