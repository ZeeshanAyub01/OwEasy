The project currently has basic functionality working at its front-end. 

How the project works:
1. Click on the get started button, or scroll down to add the names of the pariticipants in the group
2. Add all the transactions (lending and borrowing) that happened between participants
3. Click on the button that says Resolve! The resolution of all the transactions added up until that point will be displayed below the resolve button.

Note:
The glitch found recently was fixed. The front end seems to work perfectly. Feel free to report any problems to me at: ayubm@uoguelph.ca
